Pengwin is a Debian-based Linux distribution built specifically for Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Developed by Whitewater Foundry, it delivers a production-grade Linux environment on Windows with polished onboarding, strong Windows integration, and first-class support for both command-line and graphical Linux apps.

Pengwin is open-source, built by WSL users, and shaped by community feedback.

Why Pengwin

* Debian 13 (Trixie) foundation for stability, security, and a huge package ecosystem.
* Fast onboarding with `pengwin-setup`: guided setup and automation for dev tools, cloud tooling, and desktop environments.
* systemd support: enabled by default on new installs, and can be toggled on/off via pengwin-setup (existing installs opt in).
* Modern WSL export/import architecture: `wsl --export` / `wsl --import` preserves your icon and Windows Terminal profile when importing under a new name.
* Windows Terminal integration: Pengwin registers itself in Windows Terminal with a curated profile (colors/background) and improved launch behavior (starts in the current directory when launched via “Open with Windows Terminal” and when set as default).
* GPU acceleration + GPU video acceleration out of the box (no custom repos or manual environment hacks).
* Optional D3D12 acceleration toggle to disable hardware acceleration for driver compatibility or troubleshooting.
* wslu utilities included for Windows↔Linux workflows (open URLs/files, clipboard interop, Windows env vars, etc.).

What you can do with it

* Use a real Linux terminal on Windows: git, OpenSSH, Python, PowerShell, Bash, and more.
* Install developer stacks via version managers (e.g., pyenv, n, rbenv, SDKMAN!) and get modern toolchains quickly.
* Run local services for dev/test, including a one-click LAMP stack.
* Install cloud & DevOps tooling such as Terraform, Kubernetes tooling, and cloud CLIs via pengwin-setup.
* Run essential Linux GUI apps (IDEs, terminals, tools) with WSLg on Windows 11.

Desktop apps and WSL1 support

* Install a full Xfce desktop environment from pengwin-setup and launch it directly from the Windows Start Menu.
* On WSL1, pengwin-setup can install/configure VcXsrv or set up X410, and you can manage services using `wslsystemctl`.

Hybrid Windows + Linux workflow

Access your `C:` drive at `/mnt/c`, work in a mixed toolchain, and move seamlessly between ecosystems—Pengwin is designed to make the hybrid workflow feel native.

Notes

* Pengwin is Debian-based (not Ubuntu). For best results, follow Debian instructions when troubleshooting or installing packages.
* DISCLAIMER: Windows Insider Preview builds are not production-ready and may introduce incompatibilities. Support for Insider builds is best-effort.
